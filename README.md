## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned about tools like backdrop and how they can be helpfull in asthetics of the website.

### Continued development

The responsiveness of the website for the display resolution of bigger 4k screen is out of place and even for display's with width of 1440px the placement of image is not proper, gotta work on that.
